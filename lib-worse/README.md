Please include here the codeql libraries where the worse versions to boost. The folder should be named `codeql`. 

**Important**: Please note that the tool currently relies on all the codeql files in this folder. 
In the future we plan to include only  the libraries to boost and allow for other codeql libraries for running the tool.
